            <p><strong>Varanasi</strong> Vārāṇasī, Hindustani: also Banaras or Benares Banāras,
                (listen)),and Kashi (Kāshi; [kˈæʃi] (listen)is a city on the Ganges river in northern
                India that has a central place in the traditions of pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu
                world. The city has a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship that underpins its religious
                tourism.[20] Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the southeastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh,
                Varanasi lies on the left bank of the river. It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast of India's
                capital New Delhi and 320 kilometres (200 mi) to the east of the state capital, Lucknow. It lies 121
                kilometres (75 mi) downstream of Prayagraj, where the confluence with the Yamuna river and mythical
                Saraswati river is another major Hindu pilgrimage site.

                Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities. Kashi, its ancient name, was
                associated with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Lion capital of Ashoka at nearby
                Sarnath
                has been interpreted to be a commemoration of the Buddha's first sermon there in the fifth century
                BCE. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of
                Varanasi. Since ancient times, the city has been an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage,
                mysticism and poetry contributing to its cultural importance. Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language epic,
                the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi. Several other
                major
                figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and Ravidas. In the 16th century,
                Rajput nobles in the service of the courts and armies of the Mughal emperor Akbar, sponsored the
                building or
                further enhancement of the major Shiva temple in the city; they also built other temples, all displaying
                an
                empire-wide architectural style. Under the Treaty of Faizabad, the East India Company acquired
                Benares in 1775, the city later successively becoming a part of the Benares Division in the Ceded
                and Conquered Provinces, the North-Western Provinces, and the United Provinces, and after India's
                independence of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Silk weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do
                the
                Banaras Locomotive Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals. The city is known worldwide for its many ghats,
                steps
                leading down the steep river bank to the water, where pilgrims perform rituals. Of particular note are
                the
                Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat, and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two
                being where Hindus cremate their dead. The Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here. Among
                the
                notable temples in Varanasi are Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Shiva, the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, and
                the
                Durga Temple.

                The city has long been an educational and musical centre: many prominent Indian philosophers, poets,
                writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the Benares gharana
                form
                of Hindustani classical music was developed. In the 20th-century the Hindi-Urdu writer Premchand and the
                shehnai player Bismillah Khan were associated with the city. India's oldest Sanskrit college, the
                Benares
                Sanskrit College, was founded during East India Company rule in 1791. Later education in Benares was
                greatly
                influenced by the rise of Indian nationalism in the late 19th-century. Annie Besant founded the Central
                Hindu College in 1898. In 1916, she and Madan Mohan Malviya founded the Banaras Hindu University,
                India's
                first modern residential university. Kashi Vidyapith was established in 1921, a response to Mahatma
                Gandhi's
                Non-cooperation movement.</p>

            <h4>What is the Varanasi famous for?</h4>
            <p>Maharshi Patanjali, the preceptor of Ayurveda and Yoga, was also affiliated with Varanasi, the holy city.
                Varanasi is also famous for its trade and commerce, especially for the finest silks and gold and silver
                brocades, since the early days.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What is the fact about Varanasi?</h4>
            <p>It is the birth place of twenty - third Tirthankara, Parsvanath. It is the only place in the world which
                has got 84 ghats , making it the city with highest number of river banks in the world.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>How Varanasi got its name?</h4>
            <p>The official name of Varanasi is not a modern name. It is possibly based on the fact that it lies between
                where the Varuna River, to the north, and the river Assi, to the south, flow into the river Ganga . The
                name Varanasi was spelt Baranasi in Pali, which ultimately gave birth to the name Banaras.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Why is Varanasi a heritage city?</h4>
            <p>The architectural heritage of Varanasi's riverfront and its historic core are linked strongly to the
                living cultural traditions. Presently more well-known as a microcosm of Hindu pilgrimage, the city has
                been a centre of learning and revere, spanning other religions including Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Which river flows Varanasi?</h4>
            <p>The drainage system of Varanasi environs is mainly controlled by the Varuna and Asi. Both the tributaries
                join the Ganga from the city side on the western bank. Varuna river valley is less than 0.5-km wide and
                the banks are fairly high and scoured on either side.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What is the religion of Varanasi?</h4>
            <p>As per official census 2011 and population data 2023 of Varanasi district, Hindu are majority in Varanasi
                state. Total population of Varanasi district is 3,676,841 as per census 2011. Hinduism constitutes
                84.52% of Varanasi population. Muslims are minority in Varanasi state forming 14.88% of total
                population.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What is the nickname of Varanasi city?</h4>
            <p><strong>City of Light</strong><br>In the Mahabharata the city is referred to as Kāśī (काशी: Kashi) from
                the Sanskrit verbal root kaś- "to shine", making Varanasi known as "City of Light", the "luminous city
