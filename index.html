        <h2 class="text-center">About Varanasi</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Often described as a city as old as time itself, Varanasi is India’s most ancient city. Considered to be one
            of
            the
            oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Varanasi is also known as Kashi and Benares. Down the
            ages it
            has
            played a pivotal role in Indian history and culture and has been the cradle of the country’s philosophy and
            music.

            Hindus consider Varanasi, on the banks of the Ganga, as their holiest city. It gets its name from the rivers
            Varuna
            and Asi, tributaries that flow in to the Ganga in Varanasi. Also known as the ‘City of Light', legend has it
            that
            the city was founded by Lord Shiva himself. Devout Hindus consider frequent pilgrimages to Varanasi
            essential to
            attaining liberation or moksh and breathing their last in the city as tantamount to achieving it. The Buddha
            gave
            his first sermon, after attaining enlightenment, at Sarnath, close to the city.</p><br>

        <p>Varanasi has often been at the crossroads of history. The ancient road from Taxila to Pataliputra, connecting
            western
            and eastern India, passed through the city. Sher Shah Suri’s road connecting Peshawar to Kolkata also passed
            through
            it. Its fame also attracted numerous conquerors and invaders who despoiled it but never could extinguish the
            city’s
            spirit. So, it rose once again and continued to flourish.

            Over the centuries, the city has been home to numerous philosophers, musicians, artists and poets including
            Tulsidas, Kabir, Munshi Premchand and Ustad Bismillah Khan who have left their imprint on the country at
            large.
            Famous shrines, historical monuments and institutions dot the city’s landscape giving visitors a glimpse
            into
            Varanasi’s hoary past.

        <h2>A Brief History of Varanasi</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s
            Prominence
            in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature, who was
            enthralled by
            the
            legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote :
            “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all
            of
            them
            put together”.

            The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that
            one
            who
            is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and
            re-birth.
            Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed to
            have
            the
            power to wash away the sins of mortals. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi
            would
            attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth.

            Ganges is said to have its origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi, it expands to the mighty
            river
            that
            we know of. The city is a center of learning and civilization for over 3000 years. Ganges is said to have
            its
            origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi, it expands to the mighty river that we know of. With
            Sarnath,
            the place where Buddha preached his first sermon after enlightenment, just 10 km away, Varanasi has been a
            symbol of
            Hindu renaissance. Knowledge, philosophy, culture, devotion to Gods, Indian arts and crafts have all
            flourished
            here
            for centuries. Also a pilgrimage place for Jains, Varanasi is believed to be the birthplace of Parsvanath,
            the
            twenty-third Tirthankar. Vaishnavism and Shaivism have co-existed in Varanasi harmoniously.
            Varanasi has also been a great center of learning for ages. Varanasi is associated with promotion of
            spiritualism,
            mysticism, Sanskrit, yoga and Hindi language and honored authors such as the ever-famous novelist Prem Chand
            and
            Tulsi Das, the famous saint-poet who wrote Ram Charit Manas. Aptly called as the cultural capital of India,
            Varanasi
            has provided the right platform for all cultural activities to flourish. Many exponents of dance and music
            have
            come
            from Varanasi. Ravi Shankar, the internationally renowned Sitar maestro and Ustad Bismillah Khan, (the
            famous
            Shehnai player) are all sons of the blessed city or have lived here for major part of their lives.

            With a number of temples, Mrs. Annie Besant chose Varanasi as the home for her ‘Theosophical Society’ and
            Pandit
            Madan Mohan Malviya, to institute ‘Benares Hindu University, the biggest University in Asia. Ayurveda is
            said to
            be
            originated at Varanasi and is believed to be the basis of modern medical sciences such as Plastic surgery,
            Cataract
            and Calculus operations. Maharshi Patanjali, the preceptor of Ayurveda and Yoga, was also affiliated with
            Varanasi,
            the holy city. Varanasi is also famous for its trade and commerce, especially for the finest silks and gold
            and
            silver brocades, since the early days.
