        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">History</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The Banaras Hindu University was jointly established by Madan Mohan Malaviya, Annie Besant, Maharaja
            Rameshwar Singh of Darbhanga Raj and Prabhu Narayan Singh and Aditya Narayan Singh of Narayan dynasty, while
            the university is the brainchild of Malviya.


            Madan Mohan Malviya at the university
            At the 21st Conference of the Indian National Congress in Benares in December 1905, Malaviya publicly
            announced his intent to establish a university in Banaras. Malaviya continued to develop his vision for the
            university with inputs from other Indian nationalists and educationists. He published his plan in 1911. The
            focus of his arguments was the prevailing poverty in India and the decline in income of Indians compared to
            Europeans. The plan called for the focus on technology and science, besides the study of India's religion
            and culture:</p>
        <br>
        <p>Malaviya's plan evaluated whether to seek government recognition for the university or operate without its
            control. He decided in favour of the former for various reasons. Malaviya also considered the question of
            medium of instruction and decided to start with English given the prevalent environment, and gradually add
            Hindi and other Indian languages. A distinguishing characteristic of Malaviya's vision was the preference
            for a residential university. All other Indian universities of the period, such as the universities in
            Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, etc., were affiliating universities which only conducted examinations and awarded
            degrees to students of their affiliated colleges.[31] Malaviya had supported Annie Besant's cause and in
            1903, he had raised 250,000 Rupees in donations to finance the construction of the school's hostel. In
            1907 Besant had applied for a royal charter to establish a university. However, there was no response from
            the British government.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Campus</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Main campus</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Banaras Hindu University's main campus is located on the southern edge of Varanasi, near the banks of the
            river Ganges. Development of the main campus, spread over 1,370 acres (5.5 km2), started in 1916 on
            land donated by the then Kashi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh. The campus layout approximates a semicircle,
            with intersecting roads laid out along the radii or in arcs. Buildings built in the first half of the 20th
            century are fine examples of Indo-Gothic architecture.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The main entrance gate and boundary wall was built on the donation made by Maharaja of Balrampur, Maharaja
            Pateshvari Prashad Singh, and is named after him as the Singh Dwar (transl. Singh Gate).

            The Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Library is the main library on campus and houses over 1.3 million volumes as of 2011.
            Completed in 1941, its construction was financed by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda. In addition to
            the main library, there are three institute libraries, eight faculty libraries and over 25 departmental
            libraries available to students and staff.</p>

            referral hospital in the region.

            The most prominent landmark is the Shri Vishwanath Mandir, located in the centre of the campus. The
            foundation for this 252 feet (77 m) high complex of seven temples was laid in March 1931, and took almost
            three decades to complete.

            Established in 1920, Bharat Kala Bhavan is the university museum of the Banaras Hindu University. It is
            situated inside the main campus of the university with over 100,000 holdings which include artifacts,
            paintings, philately, textiles, costumes, etc</p>

            <p><strong>Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith</strong> is a public university located in Varanasi, Uttar
                Pradesh, India.
                Established in 10 February 1921 as Kashi Vidyapith and later renamed, it is administered under the state
                legislature of the government of Uttar Pradesh. It got University status in 1974 as Deemed to be
                University and State University status in 2009 by The Uttar Pradesh State Universities (Amendment) Act,
                2008 (act no. 6 of 2009). The university has more than 400+ affiliated colleges spread over six
                districts. It is one of the largest state universities in Uttar Pradesh, with hundreds of thousands of
                students, both rural and urban. It offers a range of professional and academic courses in arts, science,
                commerce, agriculture science, law, computing and management.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Foundation</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Babu Shiv Prasad Gupta and Bhagwan Das established the university in Varanasi, on 10 February 1921,
                during the non-cooperation movement of the freedom struggle. Originally named Kashi Vidyapith, the
                university was renamed Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith in 1995. It was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi.
                Kashi Vidyapith was the action field of the Indian National Movement & a pilgrimage for the Socialists.
            </p>
            <p>Inspired by Gandhi's call for self-reliance and swaraj (self-rule), the Kashi Vidyapith was the first
                modern university organised by Indians in British India. The university, along with contemporaries such
                as the Jamia Millia Islamia and the Gujarat Vidyapith, were outside the control and support of British
                authorities, supported and managed entirely by Indian nationalists and educationalists. Attracting young
                Indians from across the country, its faculty included prominent nationalists and scholars such as
                Acharya Narendra Dev, Rajendra Prasad, Jivatram Kripalani, Shriprakash and Sampurnanand. Gandhi and
                Indian nationalists encouraged Indians to boycott British-run institutions in favour of institutions
                managed entirely by Indians. Many prominent Indian industrialists and politicians provided financial and
                administrative support to the university.

                Bhagwan Das was the first vice-chancellor. Others associated with the first board of management included
                Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Jamuna Lal Bajaj, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Shiv Prasad Gupta, Acharya
                Narendra Dev, Krishna Kant Malviya, and Purushottam Das Tandon. The founding ceremony of the Vidyapith
                reverberated with the recital of Vedic mantras as well as excerpts from the Quran in the presence of
                educationists, learned persons and nationalists such as Pandit Motilal Nehru, Maulana Mohammed Ali and
                Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.</p>
            <p>Established with the resolution to keep the institution away from government recognition and grants, the
                Vidyapith was accorded the status of "Deemed University" by the UGC in 1963. This epoch-making event
                started a new chapter for the institution. Babu Sampurnanand was appointed as the chancellor and Acharya
                Birbal Singh as vice-chancellor. As the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Pt. Kamlapati Tripathi
                initiated a state government resolution to have his alma mater acknowledged as a statutory university;
                this would occur on 15 January 1974. At this point, Professor Raghukul Tilak was vice-chancellor and the
                Governor of Uttar Pradesh and would become the chancellor in accordance with the U.P. University Act. At
                present, the M.G. Kashi Vidyapith is flourishing under the able leadership of its current
                vice-chancellor, Prof. Anand K. Tyagi</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Cultural and political background</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith owes its birth to the educational, cultural and political aspirations of
                pre-independence India. The early period of this institution pulsated with the national freedom
                struggle. The teaching provided original dimensions to the concept and movement of Indian socialism.
                After seeing an educational institution in Japan during a visit in 1913–14, Prasad Gupt was inspired to
                establish an institution in India, free from government aid or interference. The boycott of
                government-aided educational institutions during the Non-Cooperation Movement coupled with Mahatma
                Gandhi's programme of National Education exerted a great deal of influence on Prasad Gupt. As a
                consequence, the Vidyapith came into being. Students joining Mahatma Gandhi's boycott call took
                admission in the Vidyapith.Shiv Prasad Gupta established the Har Prasad Smarak Nidhi in memory of his
                deceased brother, for the operation of the Vidyapith, which subsequently proved to be a fertile nursery
                for national freedom movement activities.</p>

            <p>Sanskrit Is the Most Ancient and Perfect Among the Languages of the World. Its Storehouse Of Knowledge Is
                An Unsurpassed And The Most Invaluable Treasure Of The World. This Language Is A Symbol Of Peculiar
                Indian Tradition And Thought, Which Ha Exhibited Full Freedom In The Search Of Truth, Ha Shown Complete
                Tolerance Towards Spiritual And Other Kind Of Experience Of Mankind, And Has Shown Catholicity Towards
                Universal Truth. This Language Contains Not Only A Rich Fund Of Knowledge Of People Of India But It Is
                Also An Unparalleled Way To Acquire Knowledge And It Thus Significant For The Whole World. In Order To
                Highlight Its International Significance And To Keep Intact Traditional Scholarship And To Strike A
                Compromise Between Indian And Western Outlook And To Conduct Research And Study The Various Aspects Of
                Culture And Spiritual Literature This University Was Founded On 22 March, 1958 By The Then Chief
                Minister Dr. Sampurnanand And Education Minister Pt. Kamlapati Tripathi At Varanasi, The Oldest Cultural
                City Of India, With The Name Of "Varanaseya Snskrit Vishwavidyalaya", D. A.N.Jha Being The First Vice
                Chancellor. It Was Renamed A Sampurnanand Sanskrit University under the U.P. State University Act, 1973,
                W.e.f. 16th Dec. 1974.</p>
            <p>During the period of Dr. Arthur Venis (1888-1918), the publication of Vijayanagara series of Sanskrit
                texts was accomplished. In 1909, the post examination controller was created. In 1904, an effort was
                made to give it the name and form of university. Efforts were made to collect , preserve and publish
                Sanskrit manuscripts which resulted in the establishment of the “Saraswati Bhavana” library, which is
                most reputed and well known in the whole world.

                During the principalship of Dr. Ganga Nath Jha (1918-1923) the publication of “Saraswati Bhavana
                Garnthamala” and “Saraswati Bhavana Studies” was started and specific Sanskrit texts based on deep
                research were published which marked a remarkable approach in the direction of study and dissemination
                of knowledge inherent in Sanskrit texts. Moreover, a Board of Sanskrit Studies was set up to conduct
                examination.

                Mahamahopadhyaya Pt. Gopinath Kaviraj (Principal – 1923-1937) contributed significantly through
                translation and publication of specific texts as well as cataloguing of manuscripts.</p>
            <p>In 1937, another effort was made to give it the name and form of a University but it could not
                materialize until 1956 when Varanaseya Sanskrit University Act was passed. It is remarkable that this
                college performed all those acts which an all India University is expected to do. Convocations were held
                between 1947 to 1958 every time in the manner of a University. The Sanskrit Colleges of this country and
                that of Nepal were affiliated to this college even before this University was founded. The number of
                affiliated colleges in U.P. alone was 1441. thus this college acted like a University not only for this
                country but also for other countries. Pt. Kuber Nath Shukla was the last principal of the Govt. Sanskrit
                College. He was also the first Registrar of the University.</p>

            <h4>Research Institute</h4>
            <br>
            <p>When the institution was known as Sanskrit College, all research activities were carried out by the
                principal. This included the work done on manuscripts that were kept in the Saraswati Bhavan
                Granthalaya.

                After the institution became a university, all research work was supervised by the director of the
                Research Institute, who is also the chief editor of the famous book series Sarasvati Bhavana Granthamala
                and the journal Sārasvatī Suṣamā.

                The director is responsible for overseeing all research activities within the university, and serves as
                its academic head. Being a director, the renowned grammarian Vagish Shastri had made valuable
                contributions to the Sanskrit journal Sārasvatī Suṣamā and edited numerous books in the Sarasvati
                Bhavana Granthamala series.</p>
