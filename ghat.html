                ultimate.
                The much quoted Sanskrit Skloka Proclame ‘ Kasyam maranam mukti’ (death in Kashi is Liberation). In fact
                the
                extension of this belief could be visualised in early concept of ‘ Pancha Trirtha’ symbolically

        <h4>Ghats in Varanasi</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Ghats in Varanasi are riverfront steps leading to the banks of the Ganges river. The city has 84 ghats. Most
            of the ghats are bathing and puja ceremonial ghats, while two ghats, Manikarnika and Harishchandra, are used
            exclusively as cremation sites.

            Most of the ghats in Varanasi were rebuilt in the 18th century under the maratha patronage. The patrons of
            current ghats are Marathas, Shindes (Scindias), Holkars, Bhonsles, Peshwes (Peshwas), and Maharajas of
            Benares. Many ghats are associated with legends or mythologies while other ghats have private histories and
            users. A morning boat ride on the Ganges along the ghats is a popular visitor attraction.</p>
<hr><br>
        <h4>Etymology</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Ghat, a term used in the Indian subcontinent, depending on the context could either refer to a range of
            stepped-hill such as Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats; or the series of steps leading down to a body of water
            or wharf, such bathing or cremation place along the banks of a river or pond, Ghats in Varanasi, Dhoby Ghaut
            or Aapravasi Ghat. Roads passing through ghats are called Ghat Roads.</p>
        <hr><br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Popular ghats</h2>
        <br>
        <p>According to the puranic sources, there are five key ghats on the riverfront which are important because of
            their association with a defining feature of the holy city of Kashi: Assi Ghat, Dashashwamedh Ghat,
            Manikarnika Ghat, Panchganga Ghat, Rajendra Prasad Ghat, and Adi Keshav Ghat.</p>
       <hr> <br>
        <h4>Assi Ghat</h4>
        <br>
        <p>This ghat that used to lie at the confluence of the Ganges with the dry river Asi marks the traditional
            southern boundary of the city. Asisangameshwar Temple at the ghat finds mention in the Kashi Khand of
            Skandmahapuran. This ghat is very popular because it is one of the very few ghats that is linked with the
            city through a wide street. It is also the major ghat that is closest to Banaras Hindu University. Assi
            ghat's name is derived from the river Assi. Two lingas are worshipped at this site. Assi Ghat is described,
            in some of the Puranas, as the place where the goddess Durga defeated two asuras, Shumba and Nishumba. Assi
            ghat is also the place where Tulsidas completed the Ramcharitmanas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched
            a water ATM here on 17th September 2015 on the occasion of the PM's birthday.</p>

        <h4>Dashashwamedh Ghat</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The Manikarnika Ghat is one of the cremation sites. There are two legends which are associated with the
            Manikarnika Ghat. According to one, Vishnu used his Chakra to dig a pit and filled it with his
            perspiration while performing various penances. While watching Vishnu, one of Shiva's earrings or
            manikarnika fell into the pit. According to the second legend, Parvati hid her earrings at this site to keep
            Shiva from traveling around the world. She told him that she had lost the earrings on the banks of the
            Ganges. In this legend, whenever a body gets cremated at the Manikarnika Ghat, Shiva asks the soul whether
            it has seen the earrings.</p>

        <h4>Scindia Ghat</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Scindia Ghat also known as Shinde Ghat borders Manikarnika to the north, with its Shiva temple lying
            partially submerged in the river as a result of excessive weight of the ghat's construction about 150 years
            ago. Above the ghat, several of Kashi's most influential shrines are located within the tight maze of alleys
            of Siddha Kshetra (Field of Fulfillment). According to tradition, Agni, the Hindu God of Fire was born here.
            Hindu devotees propitiate at this place Vireshwara, the Lord of all heroes, for a son.</p>
