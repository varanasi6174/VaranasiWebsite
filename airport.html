        <br>
        <p>Airports Authority of India (AAI) was constituted by an Act of Parliament and came into being on 1st April
            1995 by merging erstwhile National Airports Authority and International Airports Authority of India. The
            merger brought into existence a single Organization entrusted with the responsibility of creating,
            upgrading, maintaining and managing civil aviation infrastructure both on the ground and air space in the
            country.

            AAI manages a total of 137 airports which include 24 International airports (3 Civil Enclaves), 10 Custom
            Airports (4 Civil Enclaves) and 103 Domestic airports (23 Civil Enclaves). AAI provides air navigation
            services over 2.8 million square nautical miles of air space. During the year 2019-20, AAI handled aircraft
            movement of 1314.23 Thousand [International 156.0 & Domestic 1158.23], Passengers handled 159.59 Million
            [International 22.26 & Domestic 137.33] and the cargo handled 909.32 thousand MT [International 452.46 &
            Domestic 456.85]. Further, all Indian airports taken together have handled aircraft movement of 2587.05
            Thousand [International 431.85 & Domestic 2155.20], Passengers handled 341.05 Million [International 66.54&
            Domestic 274.51] and the cargo handled 3328.63 thousand MT [International 2003.12 & Domestic 1325.51].</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Passenger Facilities</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The main functions of AAI inter-alia include construction, modification & management of passenger terminals,
            development & management of cargo terminals, development & maintenance of apron infrastructure including
            runways, parallel taxiways, apron etc., Provision of Communication, Navigation and Surveillance which
            includes provision of DVOR / DME, ILS, ATC radars, visual aids etc., provision of air traffic services,
            provision of passenger facilities and related amenities at its terminals thereby ensuring safe and secure
            operations of aircraft, passenger and cargo in the country.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Air Navigation Services</h4>
        <br>
        <p>In tune with global approach to modernization of Air Navigation infrastructure for seamless navigation across
            state and regional boundaries, AAI has been going ahead with its plans for transition to satellite based
            Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management. A number of co-operation agreements and
            memoranda of co-operation have been signed with US Federal Aviation Administration, US Trade & Development
            Agency, European Union, Air Services Australia and the French Government Co-operative Projects and Studies
            initiated to gain from their experience. Through these activities more and more executives of AAI are being
            exposed to the latest technology, modern practices & procedures being adopted to improve the overall
            performance of Airports and Air Navigation Services.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Induction of latest state-of-the-art equipment, both as replacement and old equipments and also as new
            facilities to improve standards of safety of airports in the air is a continuous process. Adoptions of new
            and improved procedure go hand in hand with induction of new equipment. Some of the major initiatives in
            this direction are introduction of Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) in India air space to increase
            airspace capacity and reduce congestion in the air; implementation of GPS And Geo Augmented Navigation
            (GAGAN) jointly with ISRO which when put to operation would be one of the four such systems in the world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The continuing security environment has brought into focus the need for strengthening security of vital
            installations. There was thus an urgent need to revamp the security at airports not only to thwart any
            misadventure but also to restore confidence of traveling public in the security of air travel as a whole,
            which was shaken after 9/11 tragedy. With this in view, a number of steps were taken including deployment of
            CISF for airport security, CCTV surveillance system at sensitive airports, latest and state-of-the-art X-ray
            baggage inspection systems, premier security & surveillance systems. Smart Cards for access control to vital
            installations at airports are also being considered to supplement the efforts of security personnel at
            sensitive airports.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Aerodrome Facilities</h4>
        <br>
        <p>In Airports Authority of India, the basic approach to planning of airport facilities has been adopted to
            create capacity ahead of demand in our efforts. Towards implementation of this strategy, a number of
            projects for extension and strengthening of runway, taxi track and aprons at different airports has been
            taken up. Extension of runway to 7500 ft. has been taken up to support operation for Airbus-320/Boeing
            737-800 category of aircrafts at all airports.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HRD Training</h4>
        <br>
        <p>A large pool of trained and highly skilled manpower is one of the major assets of Airports Authority of
            India. Development and Technological enhancements and consequent refinement of operating standards and
            procedures, new standards of safety and security and improvements in management techniques call for
            continuing training to update the knowledge and skill of officers and staff. For this purpose AAI has a
            number of training establishments, viz. NIAMAR in Delhi, CATC in Allahabad, Fire Training Centres at Delhi &
            Kolkata for in-house training of its engineers, Air Traffic Controllers, Rescue & Fire Fighting personnel
            etc. NIAMAR & CATC are members of ICAO TRAINER programme under which they share Standard Training Packages
            (STP) from a central pool for imparting training on various subjects. Both CATC & NIAMAR have also
            contributed a number of STPs to the Central pool under ICAO TRAINER programme. Foreign students have also
            been participating in the training programme being conducted by these institution</p>
        <br>
        <h4>IT Implementation</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Information Technology holds the key to operational and managerial efficiency, transparency and employee
            productivity. AAI initiated a programme to indoctrinate IT culture among its employees and this is most
            powerful tool to enhance efficiency in the organization. AAI website with domain name
            www.airportsindia.org.in or www.aai.aero is a popular website giving a host of information about the
            organization besides domestic and international flight information of interest to the public in general and
            passengers in particular.</p>
